## Introduction
The Chart_Generator is a command-line application written in Rust, which allows users to generate different types of charts from CSV data. The user can choose from various chart types like Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Line and Area Chart, and Radar Chart.
The program takes in user input to select the desired chart type, the location of the CSV files, output filenames, and chart titles. After processing the data, it generates a visual representation of the data in the form of a chart and saves it as a PNG or SVG file.
The user-friendly prompts guide users in making the correct choices and ensure they provide the necessary inputs for each chart type. If any error occurs during the data loading or plotting phase, the program handles it gracefully and informs the user.

## Features
   
   - Multiple Chart Options: Users can generate Bar Chart, Scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Line and Area Chart, and Radar Chart.

   - Interactive User Prompts: The application provides interactive prompts for the user to make the required choices and inputs.

   - Error Handling: The program includes robust error handling to guide users in case of incorrect input or issues in data processing.

   - File Validation: Before processing, the application validates the input file names and ensures they meet the necessary criteria.

   - Customizable Output: Users can specify custom output file names and chart titles to tailor the visualizations to their needs.
